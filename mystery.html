            It’s 1935 in Gyeongseong, and struggling artist Iho Yun has been commissioned by the reclusive, elderly Madam Jeonghwa Song to paint a portrait. 
            Madam Jeonghwa Song allows Iho to set eyes upon her -- an unprecedented event -- and standing before him is a young woman. But why does she ask 
            him to paint an elderly version of her? “Don’t finish the portrait.” Tucked between the previous artist’s paint tubes is an ominous letter. Iho 
            learns that no artist has left Madam Song’s abode alive or of sound mind. Just what is she hiding and what will happen if Iho finishes the portrait?
